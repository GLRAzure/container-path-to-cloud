# Containers and the Path to the Cloud: Which Road to Take

Containers are often the simplest and quickest path to migrating applications to the cloud, as well as designing cloud-native applications. Docker containers have become the defacto standard, providing repeatable development, build, test, and production environments. Azure provides several choices for hosting options: Azure Container Instances, Web App for Containers, Azure Kubernetes Service, and Service Fabric. The focus of the workshop will be to provide an understanding of each of these hosting options, as well as provide the attendees hands-on experience with these options. By the end of this workshop, developers and infrastructure professionals will understand how to create, deploy, secure and manage the life-cycle of Docker containers across the different hosting solutions, while understanding the advantages of each option. Whether you are thinking about investigating containers, planning to do containers, or already using containers, this workshop will help you get to the next level
