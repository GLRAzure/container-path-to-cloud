# Container Path to the Cloud Setup

The labs require access to a machine that runs Docker, and an Azure Subscription in which you can setup and run new services. 

If your machine is unable to run docker or docker for windows, it is possible to execute the labs by creating a windows or linux VM in your Azure subscription and using that for the lab modules.  Just make sure you clean up (delete) the resource groups once you're done.
